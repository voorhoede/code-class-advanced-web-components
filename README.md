## 📖 Introduction
This repository contains the code for the Advanced Web Components code class. In this workshop, we'll explore three key aspects of building robust web components: state management, reactivity, and templating. Rather than just covering the basics, we'll dive deeper into the challenges you'll face when building reusable, maintainable component systems.

We'll use a timer component as our case study, progressively enhancing it through three stages to demonstrate each concept in action.

## 🏁 Getting Started

To get started with this workshop, you'll need:

```
node >= 16.x
npm >= 8.x
```

This project uses Vite as a build tool and development server.

Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd advanced-web-components
npm install
npm start
```

## 🏗️ Workshop Structure

The workshop is divided into three progressive exercises that build on each other to create a complete timer component:

1. **Exercise 1: State Management**
   - Implementing predictable state updates in components
   - Building the foundation of our timer with proper state handling
   - Learning immutable update patterns

2. **Exercise 2: Reactivity**
   - Building a subscriber pattern to react to state changes
   - Adding interval-based updates and event handling
   - Creating a responsive component that reacts to both internal and external changes

3. **Exercise 3: Templating**
   - Exploring different approaches to generate and update component UI
   - Implementing efficient rendering strategies
   - Adding conditional rendering and format options

Each directory contains starter code and instructions for the specific exercise.

## 🔍 Important Note

There is no single "correct" way to implement these concepts. The examples shown provide one approach, but there are countless alternatives depending on your specific use case, performance requirements, and personal preference. Feel free to experiment and find your own solutions!
